# InterviewAce - Frontend

**Deployed URL:** [https://interview-ace-fe.vercel.app](https://interview-ace-fe.vercel.app/)

## Project Description
InterviewAce is a **Full Stack Web Application** designed to assist candidates in preparing for interviews through an AI-powered simulation. Built with the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** and **TypeScript**, this application embodies RAD principles—rapid prototyping, iterative enhancement, and user-centred design.

The frontend is a responsive, modern single-page application (SPA) that provides a seamless user experience for registration, authentication, and interactive mock interviews generated by AI.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **Core:** React (Functional Components + Hooks), TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS (Responsive Design, Dark Mode support)
- **State Management:** Context API (Auth & Theme)
- **Routing:** React Router v7
- **HTTP Client:** Axios (Interceptors for JWT handling)
- **UI Components:** Lucide React (Icons), SweetAlert2 (Alerts & Toasts)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Main Features
1.  **User Authentication & Security**:
    -   Secure Registration and Login with JWT handling.
    -   Password Reset flow with OTP verification.
    -   SweetAlert2 integrated for enhanced user feedback (success/error popups).
2.  **AI Interview Simulator** (Advanced Feature):
    -   Generates interview questions dynamically using the **Gemini AI API** (via backend).
    -   Text-to-Speech (TTS) to read questions aloud.
    -   Speech-to-Text (STT) for capturing user answers (Web Speech API).
3.  **Community & Posts**:
    -   View and interact with interview experiences shared by other users.
    -   Pagination and skeleton loading states for better UX.
4.  **Responsive UI/UX**:
    -   Fully responsive layout using TailwindCSS.
    -   Dark/Light mode toggle.
    -   Glassmorphism effects and animated gradients.
